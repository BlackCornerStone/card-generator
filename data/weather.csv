Autochthonia,Extreme Pressure,,,3B/action,3,"Some areas rapidly fluctuate in atmospheric pressure, abruptly crushing or bursting those caught in the shift. Other areas wall off different pressure zones with invisible electrostatic barriers so that anyone crossing them experiences the differential. However it happens, the effect is a one-time or recurring hazard as appropriate.",
