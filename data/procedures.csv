Diagnose Patient,,,Perception,Medicine,"In the case of injuries, the difficulty is only 1 for external wounds and 2 for internal injuries (such as broken bones or internal bleeding).",5 minutes,
Diagnose Illness,,,Perception,Medicine,"Illnesses are more variable, with a diagnosis difficulty based
on the distinctiveness of the symptoms rather than the severity
of the disease. For instance, the common cold, infected wounds
and bubonic plague are all difficulty 1. Other examples include
cholera and smallpox (difficulty 2) and yellow fever (difficulty
3). Only extremely rare and/or magical illnesses should have a
diagnosis difficulty greater than 3. If it is a Sickness effect without
a stated difficulty to diagnose, the difficulty is the Essence of the
character who caused the effect.",6 minutes,
Craft Small Mundane Item,Mundane Craft,,"Dexterity,Perception,Intelligence",Craft,Resource Rating,"days equal to the difficulty for small items, though extremely
simple trinkets worth Resources 1 might take only a few hours
to make. Larger or higher-complexity items push the interval
from days to weeks, as with most forged goods. Massive projects
such as the construction of houses and ships take an interval of
months and possibly years for larger structures such as palaces.
Truly monumental tasks could theoretically take even longer,
although the Storyteller is encouraged to break such enterprises
into smaller, independently resolved tasks.",
